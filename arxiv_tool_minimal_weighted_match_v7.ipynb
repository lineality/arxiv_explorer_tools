            "Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized the machine learning landscape, gradually making their way into everyday tasks and equipping our computers with \"sparks of intelligence\". However, their runtime requirements have prevented them from being broadly deployed on mobile. As personal devices become increasingly powerful and prompt privacy becomes an ever more pressing issue, we explore the current state of mobile execution of Large Language Models (LLMs). To achieve this, we have created our own automation infrastructure, MELT, which supports the headless execution and benchmarking of LLMs on device, supporting different models, devices and frameworks, including Android, iOS and Nvidia Jetson devices. We evaluate popular instruction fine-tuned LLMs and leverage different frameworks to measure their end-to-end and granular performance, tracing their memory and energy requirements along the way. Our analysis is the first systematic study of on-device LLM execution, quantifying performance, energy efficiency and accuracy across various state-of-the-art models and showcases the state of on-device intelligence in the era of hyperscale models. Results highlight the performance heterogeneity across targets and corroborates that LLM inference is largely memory-bound. Quantization drastically reduces memory requirements and renders execution viable, but at a non-negligible accuracy cost. Drawing from its energy footprint and thermal behavior, the continuous execution of LLMs remains elusive, as both factors negatively affect user experience. Last, our experience shows that the ecosystem is still in its infancy, and algorithmic as well as hardware breakthroughs can significantly shift the execution cost. We expect NPU acceleration, and framework-hardware co-design to be the biggest bet towards efficient standalone execution, with the alternative of offloading tailored towards edge deployments.\n",

            "Subjects: Hardware Architecture (cs.AR) \n",
            "Abstract: Recently, the use of large language models (LLMs) for software code generation, e.g., C/C++ and Python, has proven a great success. However, LLMs still suffer from low syntactic and functional correctness when it comes to the generation of register-transfer level (RTL) code, such as Verilog. To address this issue, in this paper, we develop AutoVCoder, a systematic open-source framework that significantly improves the LLMs' correctness of generating Verilog code and enhances the quality of its output at the same time. Our framework integrates three novel techniques, including a high-quality hardware dataset generation approach, a two-round LLM fine-tuning method and a domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoVCoder outperforms both industrial and academic LLMs in Verilog code generation. Specifically, AutoVCoder shows a 0.5% and 2.2% improvement in functional correctness on the EvalMachine and EvalHuman benchmarks compared with BetterV, and also achieves a 3.4% increase in syntax correctness and a 3.4% increase in functional correctness on the RTLLM benchmark compared with RTLCoder.\n",

            "Abstract: Optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) systems aim to extract the molecular structure information, usually in the form of molecular graph or SMILES, from images of chemical molecules. While many tools have been developed for this purpose, challenges still exist due to different types of noises that might exist in the images. Specifically, we focus on the 'arrow-pushing' diagrams, a typical type of chemical images to demonstrate electron flow in mechanistic steps. We present Structural molecular identifier of Molecular images in Chemical Reaction Mechanisms (SMiCRM), a dataset designed to benchmark machine recognition capabilities of chemical molecules with arrow-pushing annotations. Comprising 453 images, it spans a broad array of organic chemical reactions, each illustrated with molecular structures and mechanistic arrows. SMiCRM offers a rich collection of annotated molecule images for enhancing the benchmarking process for OCSR methods. This dataset includes a machine-readable molecular identity for each image as well as mechanistic arrows showing electron flow during chemical reactions. It presents a more authentic and challenging task for testing molecular recognition technologies, and achieving this task can greatly enrich the mechanisitic information in computer-extracted chemical reaction data.\n",

            "Abstract: The article presents some current observations (as of April 10, 2024) on the integration of AI-generated images within processes of media convergence. It draws on two different concepts of intermediality. Primary intermediality concepts are motivated by the object when a new type of technology develops the potential to become socially relevant as a media form and thus a socially, politically, or culturally important communicative factor. Due to their uncertain 'measurements' within the wider media ecology, however, the new, still potential media form appears hybrid. The \"inter-\" or \"between-\" of this initial intermediality moment thus refers to the questionable \"site\" and the questionable description of the potential media form between already existing technologies and cultural forms and their conceptual measurements. For secondary concepts of intermediality, in contrast, it can be assumed that the boundaries of media forms and their application have already been drawn and are reasonably undisputed. This then raises the question of intentional and staged references to AI imagery within other media forms and pictures. The article discusses indicators of both intermediality moments using current examples and controversies surrounding AI images. The thesis is that there can be no talk of a seamless 'integration' of AI images into the wider media landscape at the moment (within films, comic books, or video games, for example) - as one of countless other image production techniques - and that the medial 'site' of AI image circulation - at least where it is not a matter of deception, but rather their conscious use as AI images - especially in social media communication and in fan cultures, but with repercussions for the more general media ecology and image interpretation, insofar as the suspicion that an image could be AI-generated is now increasingly present as a \"hermeneutics of suspicion\".\n",

We introduce Self Directed Synthetic Dialogues (SDSD), an experimental dataset consisting of guided conversations of language models talking to themselves. The dataset consists of multi-turn conversations generated with DBRX, Llama 2 70B, and Mistral Large, all instructed to follow a conversation plan generated prior to the conversation. We also explore including principles from Constitutional AI and other related works to create synthetic preference data via revisions to the final conversation turn. We hope this work encourages further exploration in multi-turn data and the use of open models for expanding the impact of synthetic data.\n",

            "Abstract: This article presents a new machine unlearning approach that utilizes multiple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based models. The proposed method comprises two phases: i) data reorganization in which synthetic data using the GAN model is introduced with inverted class labels of the forget datasets, and ii) fine-tuning the pre-trained model. The GAN models consist of two pairs of generators and discriminators. The generator discriminator pairs generate synthetic data for the retain and forget datasets. Then, a pre-trained model is utilized to get the class labels of the synthetic datasets. The class labels of synthetic and original forget datasets are inverted. Finally, all combined datasets are used to fine-tune the pre-trained model to get the unlearned model. We have performed the experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset and tested the unlearned models using Membership Inference Attacks (MIA). The inverted class labels procedure and synthetically generated data help to acquire valuable information that enables the model to outperform state-of-the-art models and other standard unlearning classifiers.\n",

            "Subjects: Robotics (cs.RO) \n",
            "Abstract: Dynamic graphs are extensively employed for detecting anomalous behavior in nodes within the Internet of Things (IoT). Generative models are often used to address the issue of imbalanced node categories in dynamic graphs. Nevertheless, the constraints it faces include the monotonicity of adjacency relationships, the difficulty in constructing multi-dimensional features for nodes, and the lack of a method for end-to-end generation of multiple categories of nodes. This paper presents a novel graph generation model, called CGGM, designed specifically to generate a larger number of nodes belonging to the minority class. The mechanism for generating an adjacency matrix, through adaptive sparsity, enhances flexibility in its structure. The feature generation module, called multidimensional features generator (MFG) to generate node features along with topological information. Labels are transformed into embedding vectors, serving as conditional constraints to control the generation of synthetic data across multiple categories. Using a multi-stage loss, the distribution of synthetic data is adjusted to closely resemble that of real data. In extensive experiments, we show that CGGM's synthetic data outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics. Our results demonstrate efficient generation of diverse data categories, robustly enhancing multi-category classification model performance.\n",

            "Abstract: In the realm of electronic and electrical engineering, automation of analog circuit is increasingly vital given the complexity and customized requirements of modern applications. However, existing methods only develop search-based algorithms that require many simulation iterations to design a custom circuit topology, which is usually a time-consuming process. To this end, we introduce LaMAGIC, a pioneering language model-based topology generation model that leverages supervised finetuning for automated analog circuit design. LaMAGIC can efficiently generate an optimized circuit design from the custom specification in a single pass. Our approach involves a meticulous development and analysis of various input and output formulations for circuit. These formulations can ensure canonical representations of circuits and align with the autoregressive nature of LMs to effectively addressing the challenges of representing analog circuits as graphs. The experimental results show that LaMAGIC achieves a success rate of up to 96\\% under a strict tolerance of 0.01. We also examine the scalability and adaptability of LaMAGIC, specifically testing its performance on more complex circuits. Our findings reveal the enhanced effectiveness of our adjacency matrix-based circuit formulation with floating-point input, suggesting its suitability for handling intricate circuit designs. This research not only demonstrates the potential of language models in graph generation, but also builds a foundational framework for future explorations in automated analog circuit design.\n",

            "Subjects: Computation and Language (cs.CL) \n",
            "Abstract: As a branch of advanced artificial intelligence, dialogue systems are prospering. Multi-turn response selection is a general research problem in dialogue systems. With the assistance of background information and pre-trained language models, the performance of state-of-the-art methods on this problem gains impressive improvement. However, existing studies neglect the importance of external commonsense knowledge. Hence, we design a Siamese network where a pre-trained Language model merges with a Graph neural network (SinLG). SinLG takes advantage of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to catch the word correlations in the context and response candidates and utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to reason helpful common sense from an external knowledge graph. The GNN aims to assist the PLM in fine-tuning, and arousing its related memories to attain better performance. Specifically, we first extract related concepts as nodes from an external knowledge graph to construct a subgraph with the context response pair as a super node for each sample. Next, we learn two representations for the context response pair via both the PLM and GNN. A similarity loss between the two representations is utilized to transfer the commonsense knowledge from the GNN to the PLM. Then only the PLM is used to infer online so that efficiency can be guaranteed. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two variants of the PERSONA-CHAT dataset, which proves that our solution can not only improve the performance of the PLM but also achieve an efficient inference.\n",
