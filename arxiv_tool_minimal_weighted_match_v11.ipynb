            "Subjects: Computation and Language (cs.CL) \n",
            "Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in solving text-based mathematical problems, but they struggle with mathematical diagrams since they are primarily trained on natural scene images. For humans, visual aids generally enhance problem-solving, but MLLMs perform worse as information shifts from textual to visual modality. This decline is mainly due to their shortcomings in aligning images and text. To tackle aforementioned challenges, we propose Math-PUMA, a methodology focused on Progressive Upward Multimodal Alignment. This approach is designed to improve the mathematical reasoning skills of MLLMs through a three-stage training process, with the second stage being the critical alignment stage. We first enhance the language model's mathematical reasoning capabilities with extensive set of textual mathematical problems. We then construct a multimodal dataset with varying degrees of textual and visual information, creating data pairs by presenting each problem in at least two forms. By leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of next-token prediction distributions to align visual and textual modalities, consistent problem-solving abilities are ensured. Finally, we utilize multimodal instruction tuning for MLLMs with high-quality multimodal data. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the MLLMs trained with Math-PUMA surpass most open-source MLLMs. Our approach effectively narrows the performance gap for problems presented in different modalities.\n",

            "Subjects: Software Engineering (cs.SE) \n",
            "Abstract: Current software development is often a cooperative activity, where different situations can arise that put the existence of a project at risk. One common and extensively studied issue in the software engineering literature is the concentration of a significant portion of knowledge about the source code in a few developers on a team. In this scenario, the departure of one of these key developers could make it impossible to continue the project. This work presents Knowledge Islands, a tool that visualizes the concentration of knowledge in a software repository using a state-of-the-art knowledge model. Key features of Knowledge Islands include user authentication, cloning, and asynchronous analysis of user repositories, identification of the expertise of the team's developers, calculation of the Truck Factor for all folders and source code files, and identification of the main developers and repository files. This open-source tool enables practitioners to analyze GitHub projects, determine where knowledge is concentrated within the development team, and implement measures to maintain project health. The source code of Knowledge Islands is available in a public repository, and there is a presentation about the tool in video.\n",

            "Subjects: Robotics (cs.RO) \n",
            "Abstract: Using lower-limbs exoskeletons provides potential advantages in terms of productivity and safety associated with reduced stress. However, complex issues in human-robot interaction are still open, such as the physiological effects of exoskeletons and the impact on the user's subjective experience. In this work, an innovative exoskeleton, the Wearable Walker, is assessed using the EXPERIENCE benchmarking protocol from the EUROBENCH project. The Wearable Walker is a lower-limb exoskeleton that enhances human abilities, such as carrying loads. The device uses a unique control approach called Blend Control that provides smooth assistance torques. It operates two models simultaneously, one in the case in which the left foot is grounded and another for the grounded right foot. These models generate assistive torques combined to provide continuous and smooth overall assistance, preventing any abrupt changes in torque due to model switching. The EXPERIENCE protocol consists of walking on flat ground while gathering physiological signals such as heart rate, its variability, respiration rate, and galvanic skin response and completing a questionnaire. The test was performed with five healthy subjects. The scope of the present study is twofold: to evaluate the specific exoskeleton and its current control system to gain insight into possible improvements and to present a case study for a formal and replicable benchmarking of wearable robots.\n",

            "Subjects: Machine Learning (stat.ML) \n",
            "Abstract: Practitioners frequently aim to infer an unobserved population trajectory using sample snapshots at multiple time points. For instance, in single-cell sequencing, scientists would like to learn how gene expression evolves over time. But sequencing any cell destroys that cell. So we cannot access any cell's full trajectory, but we can access snapshot samples from many cells. Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to analyze systems with full individual-trajectory access; since here we have only sample snapshots, these methods are inapplicable. The deep learning community has recently explored using Schrödinger bridges (SBs) and their extensions to estimate these dynamics. However, these methods either (1) interpolate between just two time points or (2) require a single fixed reference dynamic within the SB, which is often just set to be Brownian motion. But learning piecewise from adjacent time points can fail to capture long-term dependencies. And practitioners are typically able to specify a model class for the reference dynamic but not the exact values of the parameters within it. So we propose a new method that (1) learns the unobserved trajectories from sample snapshots across multiple time points and (2) requires specification only of a class of reference dynamics, not a single fixed one. In particular, we suggest an iterative projection method inspired by Schrödinger bridges; we alternate between learning a piecewise SB on the unobserved trajectories and using the learned SB to refine our best guess for the dynamics within the reference class. We demonstrate the advantages of our method via a well-known simulated parametric model from ecology, simulated and real data from systems biology, and real motion-capture data.\n",

            "Subjects: Software Engineering (cs.SE) \n",
            "Abstract: Planning in code is considered a more reliable approach for many orchestration tasks. This is because code is more tractable than steps generated via Natural Language and make it easy to support more complex sequences by abstracting deterministic logic into functions. It also allows spotting issues with incorrect function names with the help of parsing checks that can be run on code. Progress in Code Generation methodologies, however, remains limited to general-purpose languages like C, C++, and Python. LLMs continue to face challenges with custom function names in Domain Specific Languages or DSLs, leading to higher hallucination rates and syntax errors. This is more common for custom function names, that are typically part of the plan. Moreover, keeping LLMs up-to-date with newer function names is an issue. This poses a challenge for scenarios like task planning over a large number of APIs, since the plan is represented as a DSL having custom API names. In this paper, we focus on workflow automation in RPA (Robotic Process Automation) domain as a special case of task planning. We present optimizations for using Retrieval Augmented Generation (or RAG) with LLMs for DSL generation along with an ablation study comparing these strategies with a fine-tuned model. Our results showed that the fine-tuned model scored the best on code similarity metric. However, with our optimizations, RAG approach is able to match the quality for in-domain API names in the test set. Additionally, it offers significant advantage for out-of-domain or unseen API names, outperforming Fine-Tuned model on similarity metric by 7 pts.\n",

            "Subjects: Image and Video Processing (eess.IV) \n",
            "Abstract: In cardiac CINE, motion-compensated MR reconstruction (MCMR) is an effective approach to address highly undersampled acquisitions by incorporating motion information between frames. In this work, we propose a novel perspective for addressing the MCMR problem and a more integrated and efficient solution to the MCMR field. Contrary to state-of-the-art (SOTA) MCMR methods which break the original problem into two sub-optimization problems, i.e. motion estimation and reconstruction, we formulate this problem as a single entity with one single optimization. Our approach is unique in that the motion estimation is directly driven by the ultimate goal, reconstruction, but not by the canonical motion-warping loss (similarity measurement between motion-warped images and target images). We align the objectives of motion estimation and reconstruction, eliminating the drawbacks of artifacts-affected motion estimation and therefore error-propagated reconstruction. Further, we can deliver high-quality reconstruction and realistic motion without applying any regularization/smoothness loss terms, circumventing the non-trivial weighting factor tuning. We evaluate our method on two datasets: 1) an in-house acquired 2D CINE dataset for the retrospective study and 2) the public OCMR cardiac dataset for the prospective study. The conducted experiments indicate that the proposed MCMR framework can deliver artifact-free motion estimation and high-quality MR images even for imaging accelerations up to 20x, outperforming SOTA non-MCMR and MCMR methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation across all experiments.

            "Abstract: Deep video compression has made remarkable process in recent years, with the majority of advancements concentrated on P-frame coding. Although efforts to enhance B-frame coding are ongoing, their compression performance is still far behind that of traditional bi-directional video codecs. In this paper, we introduce a bi-directional deep contextual video compression scheme tailored for B-frames, termed DCVC-B, to improve the compression performance of deep B-frame coding. Our scheme mainly has three key innovations. First, we develop a bi-directional motion difference context propagation method for effective motion difference coding, which significantly reduces the bit cost of bi-directional motions. Second, we propose a bi-directional contextual compression model and a corresponding bi-directional temporal entropy model, to make better use of the multi-scale temporal contexts. Third, we propose a hierarchical quality structure-based training strategy, leading to an effective bit allocation across large groups of pictures (GOP). Experimental results show that our DCVC-B achieves an average reduction of 26.6% in BD-Rate compared to the reference software for H.265/HEVC under random access conditions. Remarkably, it surpasses the performance of the H.266/VVC reference software on certain test datasets under the same configuration.\n",

            "Subjects: Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) \n",
            "Abstract: The increase in the demand for eXtended Reality (XR)/Virtual Reality (VR) services in the recent years, poses a great challenge for Wi-Fi networks to maintain the strict latency requirements. In VR over Wi-Fi, latency is a significant issue. In fact, VR users expect instantaneous responses to their interactions, and any noticeable delay can disrupt user experience. Such disruptions can cause motion sickness, and users might end up quitting the service. Differentiating interactive VR traffic from Non-VR traffic within a Wi-Fi network can aim to decrease latency for VR users and improve Wi-Fi Quality of Service (QoS) with giving priority to VR users in the access point (AP) and efficiently handle VR traffic. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach for identifying interactive VR traffic in a Cloud-Edge VR scenario. The correlation between downlink and uplink is crucial in our study. First, we extract features from single-user traffic characteristics and then, we compare six common classification techniques (i.e., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes). For each classifier, a process of hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, namely permutation importance is applied. The model created is evaluated using datasets generated by different VR applications, including both single and multi-user cases. Then, a Wi-Fi network simulator is used to analyze the VR traffic identification and prioritization QoS improvements. Our simulation results show that we successfully reduce VR traffic delays by a factor of 4.2x compared to scenarios without prioritization, while incurring only a 2.3x increase in delay for background (BG) traffic related to Non-VR services.\n",

            "Abstract: Student extracurricular activities play an important role in enriching the students' educational experiences. With the increasing popularity of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, it becomes a logical step that incorporating ML-NLP in improving extracurricular activities is a potential focus of study in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This research study aims to develop a machine learning workflow that will quantify the effectiveness of student-organized activities based on student emotional responses using sentiment analysis. The study uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Large Language Model (LLM) called via the pysentimiento toolkit, as a Transformer pipeline in Hugging Face. A sample data set from Organization C, a Recognized Student Organization (RSO) of a higher educational institute in the Philippines, College X, was used to develop the workflow. The workflow consisted of data preprocessing, key feature selection, LLM feature processing, and score aggregation, resulting in an Event Score for each data set. The results show that the BERT LLM can also be used effectively in analyzing sentiment beyond product reviews and post comments. For the student affairs offices of educational institutions, this study can provide a practical example of how NLP can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing the potential impact of data-driven decision making.\n",

            "Subjects: Computation and Language (cs.CL) \n",
            "Abstract: Designing emotionally intelligent conversational systems to provide comfort and advice to people experiencing distress is a compelling area of research. Previous efforts have focused on developing modular dialogue systems that treat socio-emotional strategy prediction as an auxiliary task and generate strategy-conditioned responses with customized decoders. Recently, with advancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end dialogue agents without explicit socio-emotional strategy prediction steps have become prevalent. However, despite their excellence in language generation, recent studies show that LLMs' inherent preference bias towards certain socio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality emotional support. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction from language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy predictor, EmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user emotions and system strategies using a heterogeneous graph. Additionally, we make use of the Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) task and design a flexible mixed-emotion module to capture fine-grained emotional states of the user. Experimental results on two ESC datasets show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin.\n",

            "Abstract: Real-time character control is an essential component for interactive experiences, with a broad range of applications, including physics simulations, video games, and virtual reality. The success of diffusion models for image synthesis has led to the use of these models for motion synthesis. However, the majority of these motion diffusion models are primarily designed for offline applications, where space-time models are used to synthesize an entire sequence of frames simultaneously with a pre-specified length. To enable real-time motion synthesis with diffusion model that allows time-varying controls, we propose A-MDM (Auto-regressive Motion Diffusion Model). Our conditional diffusion model takes an initial pose as input, and auto-regressively generates successive motion frames conditioned on the previous frame. Despite its streamlined network architecture, which uses simple MLPs, our framework is capable of generating diverse, long-horizon, and high-fidelity motion sequences. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of techniques for incorporating interactive controls into A-MDM, such as task-oriented sampling, in-painting, and hierarchical reinforcement learning. These techniques enable a pre-trained A-MDM to be efficiently adapted for a variety of new downstream tasks. We conduct a comprehensive suite of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of A-MDM, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art auto-regressive methods.\n",

            "Subjects: Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) \n",
            "Abstract: Motion Manifold Primitives (MMP), a manifold-based approach for encoding basic motion skills, can produce diverse trajectories, enabling the system to adapt to unseen constraints. Nonetheless, we argue that current MMP models lack crucial functionalities of movement primitives, such as temporal and via-points modulation, found in traditional approaches. This shortfall primarily stems from MMP's reliance on discrete-time trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Motion Manifold Primitives++ (MMP++), a new model that integrates the strengths of both MMP and traditional methods by incorporating parametric curve representations into the MMP framework. Furthermore, we identify a significant challenge with MMP++: performance degradation due to geometric distortions in the latent space, meaning that similar motions are not closely positioned. To address this, Isometric Motion Manifold Primitives++ (IMMP++) is proposed to ensure the latent space accurately preserves the manifold's geometry. Our experimental results across various applications, including 2-DoF planar motions, 7-DoF robot arm motions, and SE(3) trajectory planning, show that MMP++ and IMMP++ outperform existing methods in trajectory generation tasks, achieving substantial improvements in some cases. Moreover, they enable the modulation of latent coordinates and via-points, thereby allowing efficient online adaptation to dynamic environments.\n",

            "Subjects: Computation and Language (cs.CL) \n",
            "Abstract: Compared to traditional sentiment analysis, which only considers text, multimodal sentiment analysis needs to consider emotional signals from multimodal sources simultaneously and is therefore more consistent with the way how humans process sentiment in real-world scenarios. It involves processing emotional information from various sources such as natural language, images, videos, audio, physiological signals, etc. However, although other modalities also contain diverse emotional cues, natural language usually contains richer contextual information and therefore always occupies a crucial position in multimodal sentiment analysis. The emergence of ChatGPT has opened up immense potential for applying large language models (LLMs) to text-centric multimodal tasks. However, it is still unclear how existing LLMs can adapt better to text-centric multimodal sentiment analysis tasks. This survey aims to (1) present a comprehensive review of recent research in text-centric multimodal sentiment analysis tasks, (2) examine the potential of LLMs for text-centric multimodal sentiment analysis, outlining their approaches, advantages, and limitations, (3) summarize the application scenarios of LLM-based multimodal sentiment analysis technology, and (4) explore the challenges and potential research directions for multimodal sentiment analysis in the future.\n",

            "Subjects: Computation and Language (cs.CL) \n",
            "Abstract: Generative AI offers a simple, prompt-based alternative to fine-tuning smaller BERT-style LLMs for text classification tasks. This promises to eliminate the need for manually labeled training data and task-specific model training. However, it remains an open question whether tools like ChatGPT can deliver on this promise. In this paper, we show that smaller, fine-tuned LLMs (still) consistently and significantly outperform larger, zero-shot prompted models in text classification. We compare three major generative AI models (ChatGPT with GPT-3.5/GPT-4 and Claude Opus) with several fine-tuned LLMs across a diverse set of classification tasks (sentiment, approval/disapproval, emotions, party positions) and text categories (news, tweets, speeches). We find that fine-tuning with application-specific training data achieves superior performance in all cases. To make this approach more accessible to a broader audience, we provide an easy-to-use toolkit alongside this paper. Our toolkit, accompanied by non-technical step-by-step guidance, enables users to select and fine-tune BERT-like LLMs for any classification task with minimal technical and computational effort.\n",

            "Subjects: Computation and Language (cs.CL) \n",
            "Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to comprehend human instructions and generate high-quality text. This capability allows LLMs to function as agents that can emulate human beings at a more sophisticated level, beyond the mere replication of basic human behaviours. However, there is a lack of exploring into leveraging LLMs to craft characters from diverse aspects. In this work, we introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which leverages LLMs to simulate real-world characters that can be freely customised according to various user preferences. This adaptable framework is beneficial for the design of customisable characters and role-playing agents aligned with human preferences. We propose the SimsConv dataset, which encompasses 68 different customised characters, 1,360 multi-turn role-playing dialogues, and a total of 13,971 interaction dialogues. The characters are created from several real-world elements, such as career, aspiration, trait, and skill. Building upon these foundations, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent. It incorporates diverse real-world scenes and topic-specific character interaction dialogues, thereby simulating characters' life experiences in various scenarios and topic-specific interactions with specific emotions. Experimental results indicate that our proposed framework achieves desirable performance and provides a valuable guideline for the construction of more accurate human simulacra in the future.

            "Subjects: Image and Video Processing (eess.IV) \n",
            "Abstract: In cardiac CINE, motion-compensated MR reconstruction (MCMR) is an effective approach to address highly undersampled acquisitions by incorporating motion information between frames. In this work, we propose a novel perspective for addressing the MCMR problem and a more integrated and efficient solution to the MCMR field. Contrary to state-of-the-art (SOTA) MCMR methods which break the original problem into two sub-optimization problems, i.e. motion estimation and reconstruction, we formulate this problem as a single entity with one single optimization. Our approach is unique in that the motion estimation is directly driven by the ultimate goal, reconstruction, but not by the canonical motion-warping loss (similarity measurement between motion-warped images and target images). We align the objectives of motion estimation and reconstruction, eliminating the drawbacks of artifacts-affected motion estimation and therefore error-propagated reconstruction. Further, we can deliver high-quality reconstruction and realistic motion without applying any regularization/smoothness loss terms, circumventing the non-trivial weighting factor tuning. We evaluate our method on two datasets: 1) an in-house acquired 2D CINE dataset for the retrospective study and 2) the public OCMR cardiac dataset for the prospective study. The conducted experiments indicate that the proposed MCMR framework can deliver artifact-free motion estimation and high-quality MR images even for imaging accelerations up to 20x, outperforming SOTA non-MCMR and MCMR methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation across all experiments.

            "Subjects: Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC) \n",
            "Abstract: Transparency in automated systems could be afforded through the provision of intelligible explanations. While transparency is desirable, might it lead to catastrophic outcomes (such as anxiety), that could outweigh its benefits? It's quite unclear how the specificity of explanations (level of transparency) influences recipients, especially in autonomous driving (AD). In this work, we examined the effects of transparency mediated through varying levels of explanation specificity in AD. We first extended a data-driven explainer model by adding a rule-based option for explanation generation in AD, and then conducted a within-subject lab study with 39 participants in an immersive driving simulator to study the effect of the resulting explanations. Specifically, our investigation focused on: (1) how different types of explanations (specific vs. abstract) affect passengers' perceived safety, anxiety, and willingness to take control of the vehicle when the vehicle perception system makes erroneous predictions; and (2) the relationship between passengers' behavioural cues and their feelings during the autonomous drives. Our findings showed that passengers felt safer with specific explanations when the vehicle's perception system had minimal errors, while abstract explanations that hid perception errors led to lower feelings of safety. Anxiety levels increased when specific explanations revealed perception system errors (high transparency). We found no significant link between passengers' visual patterns and their anxiety levels. Our study suggests that passengers prefer clear and specific explanations (high transparency) when they originate from autonomous vehicles (AVs) with optimal perceptual accuracy.\n",
